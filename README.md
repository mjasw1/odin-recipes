Odin Recipes -- README
##
Welcome to my recipes project! This site  will be updated over time. Right now it is in a fairly primitive state. 
##

0.1.1 - Apply rudimentary style to homepage and sub-pages. Add classes .page, .container, .subheading. [Issue #1 - Messy tree on most pages] 

0.1 - Create basic HTML site. I know nothing about version control, but making up numbers looks "nice". I will change this over time.
